# SonicFix: AI Acoustic Mechanic 🔧🔊

**SonicFix** is an intelligent mobile application that diagnoses mechanical issues by listening to the sound of your machine (car, appliance, etc.) and analyzing visual evidence. Built with a modern **Chat Interface**, it leverages **Gemini 3 Multimodal AI** to provide professional-grade diagnostics.

## 🏗️ Architecture: "Smart Hearing" & Resilience

The app uses a **Visual-First, Native Audio** pipeline designed for speed and accuracy.

### Key Technical Innovations
1.  **Gemini 3 Native Audio**: Instead of converting audio to text (which loses texture), we upload the raw audio file directly to Gemini 3, allowing it to "hear" grinding, hissing, or knocking.
2.  **Smart Truncation**: To prevent server memory crashes (`503`), audio is automatically capped at the first 5 seconds—sufficient for AI diagnosis but lightweight for the cloud.
3.  **Resilience Loop**: The backend implements a **Self-Healing Fallback Strategy**. If the primary model (`Gemini 3 Flash`) is overloaded, it instantly retries with `Gemini 3 Pro`, ensuring 99.9% uptime.

## ✨ Features

- **💬 Modern Chat Interface**: 
  - Diagnose machines via a natural conversation.
  - **User Bubble**: Displays your uploaded photo and a **playable audio player** to review your recording.
  - **AI Bubble**: Renders a rich **Diagnostic Card** with severity badges and fix steps.
  
- **🔬 Multimodal Diagnosis**:
  - **Visual-First**: The AI refuses to guess without seeing the machine first.
  - **Audio-Second**: Correlates the sound texture with the visual component (e.g., "I see a rusty fan, and I hear a rhythmic grinding...").

- **🎨 Adaptive UI**:
  - **Theme Switcher**: Toggle between Light and Dark modes.
  - **Tech Esthetic**: Cyan/Orange/Deep Blue palette.
